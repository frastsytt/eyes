    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
        By accessing or using our website and submitting your news stories (hereafter referred to as the "Service"),
        you represent that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions
        ("Terms"). If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must discontinue use of the Service

    <p>
        2.1. <strong>Submission of Content:</strong> Our platform allows users to upload news stories, images,
        and other materials (collectively, "User-Generated Content"). By submitting such content, you affirm

    </p>
    <p>
        2.3. <strong>Accuracy of Content:</strong> You agree to make reasonable efforts to verify the accuracy
        and reliability of the information contained in your submissions. Misrepresenting facts or knowingly
        spreading false information may result in the removal of your content or further measures taken by
        us, at our discretion.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
        3.1. <strong>License Grant:</strong> By submitting content, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide,
        royalty-free, perpetual, and irrevocable license (with the right to sublicense) to use, reproduce,
        distribute, display, publish, adapt, and prepare derivative works of your content for the operation
        and promotion of our website and related services.
    </p>
    <p>
        3.2. <strong>Warranties of Ownership:</strong> You represent and warrant that you have all necessary

    </p>
    <p>
        3.3. <strong>Content Attribution:</strong> We may choose to credit or attribute your content to

        sexual orientation, or other protected characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>
        4.2. <strong>Review and Removal:</strong> While we do not necessarily review all User-Generated
        Content before it is published, we reserve the right (but assume no obligation) to monitor, edit,
        remove, or refuse to post any content that violates these Terms or any applicable law, at our sole
        discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
        4.3. <strong>User Conduct:</strong> You agree not to engage in any conduct that disrupts or interferes
        with the security or operation of our Service. You will not attempt to gain unauthorized access to
        other users’ accounts, personal data, or any restricted area of our Service.

        Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        5.2. <strong>Limited Data Retention:</strong> We will retain your personal data only for as long

        period is required or permitted by law.
    </p>
    <p>
        5.3. <strong>Third-Party Sharing:</strong> We may share your personal data with service providers

        of the possibility of such damages.
    </p>
    <p>
        7.2. <strong>Aggregate Liability:</strong> In no event shall our total liability to you for all

    </p>
    <p>
        7.3. <strong>Local Jurisdiction Exceptions:</strong> Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion
        or limitation of liability for certain types of damages, so the above limitations and exclusions

        by law.

        We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to our website and your ability to submit
        content at any time for any reason, including but not limited to violations of these Terms. In the
